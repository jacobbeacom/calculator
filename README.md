# Calculator
This web application was designed as a part of The Odin Project's cirriculum.

# Explanation
Each operator is assigned to a specific function, with a specific "operate" function that acts as the calculation workhorse. Users will be able to provide 3 inputs (2 integers and an operator (all stored as variable)), and the operate function will evaluate the expression and return the result. The result will be stored as a variable, and used as the first of 2 integer inputs in the next calculation. 

There will be functions to populate the display portion of the calculator with the integer inputs of the user.

Each integer, as well as the selected operator will need to be stored as a variable to ensure calculations are ran correctly.

The operate function will then take the three variables and evaluate the expression when the user presses the '=' button.

The return value of the operate function will then be set to the display value, populating the calculator display with the result of the operation.
